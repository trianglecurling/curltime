	'Those looking a bit more closely may notice that the layout of this page is fairly horrendous. Lots of overlayed DIVs with absolute positioningâ€”yuck! Here\'s my reasoning. When I first created the app, I started with the most bare-bones HTML possible with almost no CSS. Once I got a good amount of the functionality done, I decided to go back and add CSS to skin the app. However, the plan was to make the first skin as similar as possible to "CurlTime" to make for an easy transition. However, I wanted to keep my options open for re-skinning in the future, so I wanted the HTML to be easily modified without affecting the "Classic" layout. We\'ll see in time if that was a good decision. I\'m starting to regret it!',
